# Reference approval runbook

This runbook prepares a reviewable Phase 1 reference packet. It cannot submit a remote job.

## Safe preview

1. Keep target-specific configuration and evidence under ignored `configs/local/`, `eval/local/`,
   `artifacts/local/`, `results/local/`, and `reports/local/` paths.
2. Verify the original approved-plan, provider-constraint amendment, and provider-observation
   trust-override plan SHA-256 values before editing local authority files. The budget authority
   remains bound to the original plan.
3. Populate the immutable source inventory from anonymous metadata only. Do not transfer shard
   bodies.
4. Re-observe the installed WSL environment immediately before previewing. A package, executable,
   package-tree, CUDA, driver, or runtime-lock mismatch stops the run.
5. By default, capture the isolated provider environment immediately before approval. The receipt
   must bind a local screenshot, one-container and one-GPU limits, zero active resources, the stable
   constraint contract, and privacy-safe workspace/environment digests. It expires after 15 minutes
   for approval and after 30 minutes for a future submission check. The separately approved trust
   override may instead bind the historical receipt and screenshot with explicit acceptance of
   staleness and configuration-drift risk. Never re-date the receipt or describe this path as fresh.
6. Keep the evaluation lock pending: configured context is not proven useful context, and no
   candidate execution is authorized.
7. Run the non-submitting preview:

   ```powershell
   uv run lowbit-modal-plan --config configs/local/reference.yaml `
     --db results/local/reference.sqlite
   ```

The JSON result must show `submit:false`, `weights_transferred:false`, `actual_cost_usd:"0"`, and
every unresolved blocker. Previewing never creates or consumes an execution approval.

## Evidence required before a future execution request

- Exact inventory, provenance, installed-runtime, evaluation, reviewed-commit, and control-plane
  identities.
- A separately reviewed formula authority. Numeric promotion thresholds remain absent.
- A stable provider-constraint contract plus either a fresh observation receipt or the exact hashed
  human trust override. Preview output must distinguish `fresh_observation` from
  `human_trust_override`. Neither mode is a dollar cap or bounds provider-managed rescheduling.
- A separately hashed billing-authority contract defining the environment-scoped attribution method,
  authoritative report identity, and completeness delay.
- Hashed memory-fit evidence whose method matches the formula authority and stays within the fixed
  A100-80GB envelope.
- Hashed cold-path evidence covering positive transfer, verification, load, evaluation, and safety
  margin durations inside 2,700 seconds.
- A clean reviewed tree and a short-lived approval artifact matching the canonical challenge,
  reviewed commit, all three plan authorities, every provider evidence identity including any trust
  override, the exact cap from the ignored local ledger, explicit residual-risk acceptance, and expiry.

## Hard stop

U8 remains unauthorized. This repository contains no `modal.App`, remote function, deploy, spawn,
or submit entrypoint. Do not add one, transfer weights, reserve money, or register an approval until
a human separately approves the exact U7 packet and reviewed commit. Provider authentication may be
configured locally, but it is not execution authority and credentials must never enter the repository.
Unknown billing after any future submission must become `audit_blocked`; it must never release
reusable budget. Every submitted or later state permanently consumes its execution scope.

The controller handoff reads `total_ledger_ceiling_usd` from the validated ignored local ledger and separates it from
`current_action_authorized_cap_usd:"0.00"`. The total ledger is not authority to spend it, and
`proposed_action_cap_usd:null` means no paid evidence action has been allocated. Until a later
approved plan supplies that allocation and a reviewed provider adapter, `command_available` remains
false and there is no executable paid command to approve.

No approval text is generated while the command and exact paid-action contract are absent. A future
approval must bind the complete paid-action packet, exact command, challenge, cap, and reviewed
lineage. The current readiness-packet SHA-256 is evidence for planning, not execution authority.
